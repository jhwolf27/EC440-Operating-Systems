The entire process was very tedious and took alot of configuration. I also had to borrow another student's raspberry pi to use with the breadboard as mine was broken. The syntax is very different from anything I have worked with before which caused a lot of confusion and frustration. It took a long time to find out where exactly the syntax error was or where a typo was located. Otherwise it wasn't too bad. It was just very elusive.
